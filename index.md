   2600 MYA - Prokaryotic to Eukaryotic Cell Evolution
  </h1>
    <p>
      2.7 billion years ago, life on earth consisted of only microbes and single cell organisms called prokaryotes. Evolution and the emergence of eukaryotic cells was an important milestone as it laid the foundations for complex life. Many different theories seek to describe the evolution of eukaryotic cells, however no theory has yet been thoroughly established. Currently, the most popular theory is the Endosymbiotic Theory, which describes the evolutionary relationship between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This article outlines the aforementioned theory, as well as some lesser known conjectures, including Viral Eukaryogenesis.

     Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells
  </h2>
    <p>
      A prokaryote is a unicellular organism (consisting of one prokaryotic cell) that lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a broad domain that includes organisms such as bacteria and cyanobacteria. Within these cells, genetic material is found within the nucleoid, which is a string-like structure that floats within the cytoplasm of the organism. Most prokaryotes move using flagella, which is a structure that acts as its propellent mechanism. Pilus and the cell capsule can be used to adhere to other organisms. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotes are defined by the clear presence of a nuclear envelope. This term is a broader domain of cells that include both plant and animal cells. Typically, these cells also contain a host of other organelles, such as mitochondria (releases energy from other sugars), a golgi apparatus (packages substances into vesicles), an endoplasmic reticulum (produces proteins), and lysosomes (degrade cellular waste). Eukaryotes evolved subsequently from prokaryotes, and serve as the foundation for multicellular organisms. The key distinctions between these different types of cells have allowed for the discovery of evolutionary pathways that attempt to explain cellular evolution.

    Endosymbiotic Theory
  </h2>
    <p>
      The endosymbiotic theory describes that larger cells engulfed smaller cells (prokaryotes) in a symbiotic relationship (close association), leading to the development of eukaryotic organelles (1). These larger cells were thought to be amoeba that got nutrients via phagocytosis, consuming prokaryote bacteria. Some of the bacteria ingested were capable of aerobic respiration, later becoming mitochondria, while chloroplasts were formed by ingesting photosynthetic bacteria. Longstandlingly, the acquisition of foreign organisms in a symbiotic relationship served as the basis for the creation of eukaryotic cells. Evidence for this theory is in relation to the characteristics of both mitochondria and chloroplasts (2). These organelles are roughly the same size as most prokaryotic cells, divide through binary fission (duplication of genetic material), and contain similar proteins at their cell-division plane. Moveover, both these organelles have their own nonlinear, circular DNA (genetic material that is formed by a closed loop) as well as their own ribosomes (particles consisting of DNA) independent of their host cell. Paleoproxy (materials preserved from the past) evidence suggests that older, more primitive eukaryotes have a nuclear membrane, but an absence of mitochondria (indicating a gradual acquisition). Over the next several billion years, Eukaryotic cells would acquire different organisms leading to a diverse subdomain of newer cells (3).
    Support for this theory may be found in the article Origin and evolution of eukaryotic apoptosis: the bacterial connection, published in the scientific journal “Cell Death and Differentiation” (4). The authors theorised different ways in which Programed Cell Death (PCD) , a hallmark of eukaryotic cells, has origins in prokaryotic cells. While PCD as a function does not exist in prokaryotes, certain important elements of PCD , such as caspases could be found in prokaryotes. The authors compared data of genetic domains (see page 3-4) of different organisms as well as constructing phylogenetic trees (see page 5). The authors of the study showed that the HTRA-like proteases have genetic domains that could be found in eukaryotic cells of increasing complexity (humans-worms) as well as different examples of  prokaryotic cells. In addition, a phylogenetic tree was created for the same proteas showing the diversification of this family into multiple distinct lineages of bacteria. Through this data analysis the authors were able to show that not only was the protease able to pass on from increasingly complex bacteria (the phylogenetic tree) but also potentially transfer to more complex organisms like eukaryotes. 
    Some evidence supporting the endosymbiotic theory was only obtained recently via DNA sequencing. Genome analysis has demonstrated that bacterial origin outnumbered the genes of archaeal origin in yeast and other eukaryotic genomes by a factor of 3:1, and that the nuclear genes in photosynthetic eukaryotes are acquisitions from the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from cyanobacteria (6). This theory also suggests that nuclear DNA has been derived from prokaryotic DNA through a process called lateral gene transfer (LGT), “DNA transfer from organelles to the nucleus occurs in all eukaryotic genomes studied to date”. The figure above shows an ideal gene acquisition via endosymbiosis, notably, eukaryotic cells are nested within the prokaryotic gene evolution.

    Viral Eukaryogenesis Theory
  </h2>
    <p>
      This theory states that the cell of eukaryotes evolved from a bacteriophage in the form of an endosymbiosis relationship with methane producing archeon. This theory suggests that eukaryotic cells have a viral ancestor for their nucleus, an archeal ancestor for cytoplasm, and a bacterial ancestor for mitochondria. This theory shares many parallels with the Symbiosis theory outlined above, but distinguishes that the nuclear material of the cell was derived from a viral infection of a methanogenic mycoplasma bacteria (generates a form of energy by synthesizing methane). Most notably, the theory outlines that mRNA capping, linear chromosomes, and separation of transcription from translation are evidence that the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell has viral origin (7).

    Conclusion
  </h2>
    <p>
      There are many different theories describing the evolution from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells, however, the prevailing explanation is the Endosymbiotic Theory. This theory postulates that a symbiotic relationship exists for prokaryotic bacteria derived organelles that are contained within a eukaryotic cell. Evidence for this theory concerns the similarity between mitochondria, chloroplasts, and normal prokaryotic bacteria, as well as genetic similarities within organelles and other proteins of the eukaryotic cell. The Viral Eukaryogenesis Theory postulates that the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell has viral origin. In essence, the development of the eukaryotic cell laid the foundation for multicellular life.
